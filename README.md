# üî•Project 4: Users Uploading Streak Dashboard
# ================================
## *Project Overview:*
This is a small task within our team's project focused on analyzing user shopping behavior through uploaded receipts. The dashboard will analyze the data and identify panelists meeting certain criteria, such as:
- *Uploading more than 10 receipts within 30 days*
- *Participating for more than 7 days*
- *Having a rejection rate below 20%*
- *Not being included in the blocked respondents list*

## *My Role:*

- Received the requirements and conducted detailed discussions to fully understand the teammate's needs.
- Requested data sourcing from the team via Power BI data flows (from the team's database). *(Due to time constraints, I have not yet had the opportunity to thoroughly learn about these data flows.)*
- Utilized Power Query to clean and format data for analysis (e.g., filtering out blanks in the Phone field, creating a dim_calendar table, sorting by MonthYear or WeekNum).
- Employed DAX functions to analyze data according to specified criteria (using Row Context).

## *Output:*
Generated a monthly list of qualified panelists within specified time periods.
## *Dashboard:*
![First Version](Image/Panelist/1.png)
This version uses HTML to customize streak calculation, displaying streaks by week within specific timeframes. However, since users need to download Excel files, it must revert to raw data.
![First Version - QC Page](Image/Panelist/2.png)
This is a drill-through page used for quality control, allowing checks on previously selected panelists.
![Second Version](Image/Panelist/3.png)
This page has been adjusted according to user requirements and is currently filtered to display all panelists.
![Second Version - Filtered](Image/Panelist/4.png)
This page is filtered to show panelists with the highest streaks in June.
![Second Version - Filtered](Image/Panelist/5.png)
This is the page where users requested additional conditions to calculate streaks for individual panelists
