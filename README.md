## *Project Overview:*
Collected store-level data through mystery shopping: surveyed sellers on Milo SKU prices (per client brief) and recorded whether POSM materials (standee, booth, pallet) were present.

## *My Role:*

- Built the dimensional model and relationships for the dashboard.
- Wrote DAX measures to compute KPIs and surface insights.
- Leveraged tooltips for quick, in-context data views.

# üî•Project 4: Users Uploading Streak Dashboard
# ================================
## *Project Overview:*
This is a small task within our team's project focused on analyzing user shopping behavior through uploaded receipts. The dashboard will analyze the data and identify panelists meeting certain criteria, such as:
- *Uploading more than 10 receipts within 30 days*
- *Participating for more than 7 days*
- *Having a rejection rate below 20%*
- *Not being included in the blocked respondents list*

## *My Role:*

- Received the requirements and conducted detailed discussions to fully understand the teammate's needs.
- Requested data sourcing from the team via Power BI data flows (from the team's database). *(Due to time constraints, I have not yet had the opportunity to thoroughly learn about these data flows.)*
- Utilized Power Query to clean and format data for analysis (e.g., filtering out blanks in the Phone field, creating a dim_calendar table, sorting by MonthYear or WeekNum).
- Employed DAX functions to analyze data according to specified criteria (using Row Context).

## *Output:*
Generated a monthly list of qualified panelists within specified time periods.
## *Dashboard:*
### First Version
This version uses HTML to customize streak calculation, displaying streaks by week within specific timeframes. However, since users need to download Excel files, it must revert to raw data.

### First Version - QC Page
This is a drill-through page used for quality control, allowing checks on previously selected panelists.
